# Vision

A complete, queryable record of Singapore's parliamentary proceedings — from the colonial Legislative Assembly through the present — for researchers studying political history at scale.

---

## Objectives

### 1. Complete corpus coverage
Fetch and store every Hansard entry published by SPRS, across all parliaments and all report types. No gaps from rate limits, format changes, or API quirks. The raw API response for every record is preserved exactly as received.

### 2. Per-utterance speaker index
Extract individual speeches from parliamentary transcripts and attribute each one to the correct speaker. Each `Speech` row represents one utterance — a single content line in the debate — with an `ordinal` that preserves delivery order within the report. The speech table is a queryable, speaker-filtered index over the report content: a researcher can retrieve all speeches by a given speaker across the corpus, sorted by ordinal to read them in context. The `markdown_content` on `Report` is the source of truth; speeches are a derived index over it, not a line-for-line mirror.

Attribution should be as complete as the source material allows. Documents that remain unattributed must be structurally unattributable (appendix link indexes, colonial-era procedural orders with no named author). Two structural limits apply by design: single-speaker documents are stored as one `Speech` row spanning the full body rather than per-line rows; documents with multiple speakers but no bold speaker markup produce zero `Speech` rows.

### 3. Rich sitting metadata
For every sitting date, capture full session metadata: attendance, permissions to be absent, debate sections, vernacular speeches, and annexures. Both pre- and post-August 2015 API formats are handled faithfully.

### 4. Speaker identity linking
Connect every speech and attendance record to a canonical speaker identity (name, party, parliament number) sourced from parliament.gov.sg.

### 5. High-fidelity markdown
Convert raw HTML records into clean, readable markdown that downstream consumers can trust — stripping artifacts introduced by html2text across three distinct document eras (colonial, mid-era, modern) without losing any substantive content.

### 6. Parsing quality
Track parsing success rates per report type across the full corpus so regressions surface before they accumulate and improvement work is measurable.

## Strategies

### Raw first, derive second
Every external API response is stored in a raw response table before any transformation occurs. Entity tables (Report, Speech, Sitting) are pure extensions of their raw counterparts — no fields dropped, no values changed. The source of truth is always recoverable, and re-parsing is cheap: drop the derived rows, rerun the populate step.

### Staged, incremental population
The pipeline runs in discrete stages: fetch → parse → enrich. Each stage can be re-run independently. Skip logic at each stage makes the pipeline idempotent and resumable after failures or interruptions.

### Async HTTP with rate-limit resilience
Fetching thousands of records requires concurrent HTTP. The gateway layer uses async requests with exponential backoff and jitter on 429 responses, so the pipeline self-throttles under load rather than failing hard or hammering the server.

### Iterative parsing refinement
Parsing improvements follow a structured loop: inspect failure categories, apply a targeted fix, check per-report-type statistics, and commit. Each cycle is reviewed before merging to keep regressions visible across the ~22,000-document corpus.

### Format-aware artifact removal
The raw HTML spans three document eras with different artifacts. Fixes are applied as targeted transformations scoped to the artifact each addresses — stripping known separator patterns, merging bold lines split across page breaks, normalising whitespace — rather than globally, which limits blast radius when the source HTML varies.

### Principled attribution hierarchy
For documents that contain no bold speaker markup, attribution follows a deliberate fallback chain:
1. If the `MPs Speaking` header lists exactly one name, attribute the entire body to that speaker (adjournment motions, bill first readings, procedural resolutions).
2. If the body follows a known ministerial attribution pattern (ministry heading + name + title), extract the minister from the body.
3. If neither applies, leave unattributed — do not fabricate attribution for multi-speaker appendix documents or structurally authorless procedural orders.

### Diagnostic tooling as a first-class concern
Targeted validation and inspection tools live alongside the main pipeline. Parsing statistics are exported after every run. These tools make it possible to audit specific failure categories by report type without re-running the full pipeline, keeping the feedback loop short.
